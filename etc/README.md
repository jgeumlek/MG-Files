# System Files

A system-wide installation of MoltenGamepad can offer several benefits. Base devices will *always* be invisible to regular users without having to change permissions, and virtual devices will always be visible. Systemd can make sure a directory is available for MG's fifo, and start it automatically. Run install.sh to deploy this setup.
